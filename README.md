# Constraint-Satisfaction-Problem
This project solves the **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** using backtracking search, focusing on the map coloring problem. It ensures that adjacent regions are assigned different colors while satisfying all constraints. Implemented in Python, the project includes examples for 12 countries, Oman states, and Australian states.

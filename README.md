# Map Coloring (Backtracking Search)

## Overview
This project addresses the **Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)** through the lens of the map coloring problem. Using **backtracking search**, the program ensures that adjacent regions are assigned different colors while satisfying all constraints. The project is implemented in Python and provides examples of map coloring for various regions, including 12 countries, Oman states, and Australian states.

---

## Problem Statement
The goal is to assign colors to regions on a map such that:
- No two adjacent regions share the same color.
- The solution satisfies all constraints using a finite domain of colors.

---

## Features
- **Backtracking Search Algorithm**: Systematic exploration of possible assignments.
- **Domains and Constraints**:
  - Domains: Predefined set of colors (e.g., Red, Green, Blue, Yellow).
  - Constraints: Adjacent regions cannot share the same color.
- **Implemented Examples**:
  1. 12 countries with 4-color and 2-color domains.
  2. Oman states with 4-color domains.
  3. Australian states with 3-color domains.

---

## Map Coloring Examples

### 1. 12 Countries
- **Constraints Satisfied**:
  - Using 4-color domains.
  - Output assigns valid colors to all regions.
- **Constraints Not Satisfied**:
  - Using 2-color domains.
  - Some regions remain uncolored.

### 2. Oman States
- **Regions**:
  - Muscat, Dhofar, Al Wusta, Ad Dakhiliyah, Ash Sharqiyah North/South, etc.
- **Goal**:
  - Assign colors (Red, Green, Blue, Yellow) ensuring no two adjacent states share the same color.

### 3. Australian States
- **Regions**:
  - Western Australia, Northern Territory, South Australia, Queensland, etc.
- **Goal**:
  - Use 3 colors (Red, Green, Blue) to satisfy constraints.

---

## How It Works
1. **Algorithm**:
   - Define regions as variables.
   - Assign colors from the domain while checking constraints.
   - Backtrack when constraints are violated.
2. **Functions**:
   - `def promising`: Validates assignments based on constraints.
   - `def get_color_for_state`: Assigns colors to regions.
   - `def main`: Runs the program and outputs results.

## Usage Instructions
1. **Requirements**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Visual Studio Code or Jupyter Notebook
2. **Run the Program**:
   - Execute the Python file.
   - Choose one of the three options:
     - `1`: Map coloring for 12 countries.
     - `2`: Map coloring for Oman states.
     - `3`: Map coloring for Australian states.
3. **Example Command**:
   ```python
   print("1. Show 12 countries using CSP Backtracking")
   print("2. Show Oman (11 states) using CSP Backtracking")
   print("3. Show Australia (7 states) using CSP Backtracking")
   num = int(input("Enter: "))
   ```

## Benefits of CSP Backtracking
### Pros:
- Finds all possible solutions.
- Step-by-step and easy-to-understand implementation.
- Suitable for a wide range of problems.

### Cons:
- High computational cost.
- Inefficient for large datasets.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating AI-based techniques for better performance.
- Exploring heuristic methods to improve computational efficiency.
- Extending the application to more complex constraint satisfaction problems.
